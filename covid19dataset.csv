"1. Confidence intervals used up to and including the period 22 June to 5 July, following which credible intervals have been presented due to change in modelling approach.",,,,,,,,,,,
"2. Due to the timeliness of the data received from the laboratories and occurrence of public holidays there are gaps and overlaps between some of our official estimates, this does not impact the comparability of these estimates.",,,,,,,,,,,
